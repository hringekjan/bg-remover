I'll research best practices for creating comprehensive artifact bundles for software development projects, including directory structures, file organization, manifest generation, and archiving techniques.

Let me search for relevant information about artifact management, software release bundling, and best practices for organizing development artifacts.

## Research Report: Best Practices for Creating Comprehensive Software Artifact Bundles

### Summary of Findings:
Creating comprehensive artifact bundles for software projects requires a systematic approach to organize, document, and package all relevant files. Best practices include establishing a clear directory structure that separates different types of artifacts (source code, tests, documentation, build outputs), generating meaningful manifest files that track contents and metadata, and using standardized archiving formats. Key components typically include source files, test artifacts, documentation, performance metrics, deployment guides, and state checkpoints. The process should ensure reproducibility, traceability, and ease of deployment while maintaining security and integrity through checksums or digital signatures.

### Key Points:
*   **Directory Structure**: Establish a logical hierarchy separating implementation artifacts (source/test files) from incubator artifacts (scripts, checkpoints) and generated documentation
*   **Manifest Files**: Create comprehensive manifests including an artifact index (JSON format), executive summary, detailed metrics report, and deployment instructions
*   **File Organization**: Include all source files, test files, documentation, test results, coverage reports, state checkpoints, workflow recipes, and scripts
*   **Archiving Best Practices**: Use standard compression formats (tar.gz) with timestamps, verify archive integrity, and maintain consistent naming conventions
*   **Traceability**: Ensure all bundled artifacts are versioned and linked to specific development phases or milestones
