I'll help you research the necessary updates for your project documentation. Let me search for information about documentation best practices and project status tracking methods.

```json
{
  "name": "GoogleWebSearch",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "software project documentation best practices updating status tracking"
  }
}
```

Let me also look for specific guidance on maintaining repository structure documentation and README files.

```json
{
  "name": "GoogleWebSearch",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "repository structure documentation best practices README updates project status"
  }
}
```

Now I'll search for examples of project status pages and how to effectively communicate completion status in technical documentation.

```json
{
  "name": "GoogleWebSearch",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "technical project status page examples what's complete in progress planned"
  }
}
```

Let me fetch content from some of these resources to get detailed information.

```json
{
  "name": "WebFetch",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://documentation.divio.com/"
  }
}
```

Let me fetch another resource about README best practices.

```json
{
  "name": "WebFetch",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://www.makeareadme.com/"
  }
}
```

Let me get information about project status tracking from a third resource.

```json
{
  "name": "WebFetch",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://github.com/blog/454-how-we-keep-track-of-our-project-roadmap"
  }
}
```

Based on my research, I can now provide recommendations for updating your project documentation. Here's a structured approach for each requested update:

## Research Report: Software Project Documentation Updates and Status Tracking

### Summary of Findings:
Effective software project documentation requires clear organization and regular updates to reflect current project status. According to Divio's documentation system, documentation should be structured into four distinct categories: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation. For project status tracking, it's important to maintain clear distinctions between what's complete, in progress, and planned. README files should follow a standard structure including project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. Repository structure documentation should clearly map components to their locations and purposes.

### Key Points:
*   **Documentation Structure**: Follow Divio's system with four categories (tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, explanation) for comprehensive coverage
*   **Status Communication**: Clearly separate completed work, ongoing efforts, and future plans using consistent formatting
*   **README Standards**: Include essential elements like project description, quick start guide, installation steps, and contribution process
*   **Repository Documentation**: Maintain accurate mapping of components to directory structures with brief descriptions of each module's purpose
*   **Artifact Linking**: Provide direct links to downloadable artifacts with version information when applicable
